# Integration Exercise: Mail Servers

_written by: Gregory Brown_

While most of our attention these days gets directed towards web applications,
there is something to be said for the universal medium of email. In this
exercise, you'll build a simple mail server that provides an interesting service
for its users via email.

## Examples

- An archival system for sharing documents. Email an attachment to the service
and it will be stored. Other users can query the system by email to see what
documents are available, and request files to be sent to them from the archives
via email.

- An email based [Multi-User Dimension](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD) which
  allows players to navigate various themed rooms. When in a given room, the
  user will be able to easily email other people who are in that room similar
  to how a mailing list works. 

## Exercise Summary

- Proposal an interesting mail server idea application to implement
  - No two students should work on the same idea
  - Your idea should incorporate multi-user interactions in some way
  - If you get stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help.
- Implement your idea. You can use any mail software you'd like, but it's
recommended to check out the mail gem, as it provides most of the
functionality you'll need.
